 Basics
========

- The world is divided in chunks with coordinates chunkY:chunkX
- Each chunk is divided in cells with coordinates x:y:x
  - z is altitude.
  - all x, y and z are in [0-16). Meaning max altitude is 15 for now.
    16 is the "chunk size" also defined on the server side.
  - z == 0 means the floor, so it is possible to draw roads, and paths....
- There are 3 types of zones:
  - Live: what is lighten up, and updated live with actions from other players.
    You can see them, see what they do, and they can hear you.
    Although in theory this could be as big as needed, for now I would rather
    keep it small (2x2 chunks) to see how the server react. For every message
    it has to check all the chunks to decide to whom send the updates.
  - The Shadows: The portion of the world that you have visited, but is not
    updated live In the first version, it is painted faded. you don't see other
    players in the shadows, and don't receive their updates.
  - The Darkness: You don't see anything there. you haven't visited this part
    of the world yet.
- The player is 2 blocks tall, and can jump 1 block high only.

============
 Dev Server
============

You can connect your clients to a dev server located at cube.leppoc.net:10234.
This server runs the same code as cube.leppoc.net, but accepts incomming connection from
"localhost" and "192.168.X.X:X" ip addresses. Also the database is non persisted.

 Protocol & API

// TODO. Not needed if using the JS Library

==================================
 How to implement a new JS client
==================================
(Using the provided JS Library)

It should be easy to re-use the JS that is already implemented, talks to the
server, takes care of caching the world pieces, send updates to the renderer,
etc.

i2 thing need to be implemented to use the basic js already written:
  - a renderer class.
  - a console class.

These 2 classes are described in the interfaces.js file.

That's it.

The implementation usually can call functions and use members that don't start with "_".
- player.selectAction(a)
  a is in [0,9] 0 being "destroy" action, [1-9] are cube building actions.
- player.moveZ()
  after a cube is added or destroyed, calling this function makes sure that the
  player position is updated to be on top of the cubes.
- player.isOn(chunkY, chunkX, z, y, x)
  says if the player is on top of the given cell
- player.move(dx, dy)
  move the player of dx, dy cells. dx and dy should be max -1, 0 or 1.
- player.act(dx, dy)
  Act (build a cube, or destroy one) on the cell around the player's position.
  dx and dy should be max -1, 0 or 1.
- world.getCell(chunkY, chunkX, z, y, x)
  Returns the cell value. e.g. "1" for a red cube. "0" or "" for empty.
- world.isEmpty(chunkY, chunkX, z, y, x)
  Checks if the cell is empty. Essentially checks for a value of "0" or "".
- world.getPlayers(chunkY, chunkX, z, y, x)
  Get a list of players at the given cell.
- world.hasChunk(chunkY, chunkX)
  Says if the chunk is known (i.e. NOT in The Darkness)
- world.isLiveChunk(chunkY, chunkX)
  Says if the chunk is live (i.e. NOT in The Darkness and NOT in The Shadows)
- world.pendingChunk(chunkY, chunkX)
  Says if the world is waiting for the given chunk for the server.



When the player takes an action, the client will call player.act, for example.
The player class will take care of sending that to the server through the
communication layer. The server will respond with an action, send the update to
the listener, which in turn tells the renderer to update the drawing:

The following serie of event occurs when the user changes a cube for example
1. client receives key strokes
2. client calls player.act
3. player.act checks what to do, and call Comm.setCell
5. Comm.setCell sends update to the server
4. server writes to database
5. server sends updates to all concerned clients
6. client receives update in Comm
7. Comm notifies the CommListener
8. CommListener updates the World, and ping the renderer via renderer.setDirty()
9. renderer repaints the world.

This way, the state stays consistent and the server is always the reference
point.  One drawback may be the latency between an action, and seeing it
reflected on the screen. So far it hasn't been a problem with few clients:
websockets are pretty fast.


Sample main
-----------

function main() {
  // Generic stuff.
  var chunkSize = 16;  // Must be 16 to match the server.
  var player = new Player();
  var world = new World(chunkSize);
  var commListener = new CommListener();
  var comm = new Websockets();
  var console = new Console();

  // Specific renderer implementation
  var renderer = new Renderer();

  // Setup phase. Give everyone what they need.
  // Generic stuff
  player.setup(comm, world, renderer);
  commListener.setup(world, renderer, console);
  // Only the dev server, at cube.leppoc.net:10234 accepts external connections.
  comm.setup(commListener, "ws://cube.leppoc.net:10234", "http://cube.leppoc.net:10234");

  // Renderer implementation stuff
  renderer.setup(chunkSize, world, comm, console, player, ui);
  setInterval(function() {renderer.repaint();}, 40);
};
